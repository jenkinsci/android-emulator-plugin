Runs the Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html">Application
Exerciser Monkey</a> tool on an Android emulator or device.
<p>
Unless a filename is entered under the &quot;Advanced&hellip;&quot; section, the monkey results will
be written to a file named "<tt>monkey.txt</tt>" in the root of the workspace.<br>
Selecting the &quot;Publish Android monkey tester results&quot; option below can examine this file
at the end of the build and publish a summary on the build page.
</p>
<p>
If an Android emulator was started automatically via the "Run an Android emulator
during build" option above, <tt>monkey</tt> will be run on that device.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the tool will be run on an emulator or USB-attached Android device.<br/>
If more than one emulator or device is present, this step will currently hang until
only one emulator or device is available &mdash; this is the default Android SDK behaviour.
