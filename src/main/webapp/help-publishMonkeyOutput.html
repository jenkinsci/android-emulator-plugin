Selecting this option will examine the output of the Android
<a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html">Application Exerciser
Monkey</a> tool and publish a summary to the build page.<br/>
If it is determined that <code>monkey</code> crashed the application or a not-responding situation
occurred, the build will be marked as unstable, unless another "Set build result" option is chosen.
<p>
Unless a filename is entered below, the output will be read from a file called "<em>monkey.txt</em>"
in the root of the build workspace.

To run <code>monkey</code> automatically on an Android emulator or device and write the results to a
file, select &quot;Add build step&quot; above and choose &quot;Run Android monkey tester&quot;.
