With this option enabled, the Android SDK will be automatically downloaded, installed and configured
on any machine where builds occur with the &quot;Run an Android emulator during build&quot; option enabled.
<p>
The SDK will be downloaded on-demand, the first time a job is built which requires it.<br>
The SDK will be installed to <tt>$JENKINS_HOME/tools/android-sdk</tt> on the build machine.<br>
If a working Android SDK is found on such a machine, the SDK will not be downloaded or installed.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, any Android prerequisites required to create a certain emulator will be installed when
Jenkins detects that they are required.  For example, if a job is configured to use an emulator
with Android 3.2, but this is not yet installed, it will be automatically downloaded and installed
when that job is built. This requires that you have Android SDK Tools r14 or later installed.
</p>
For each build, the path to the Android SDK being used is exposed via the <tt>ANDROID_HOME</tt>
environment variable.
