This determines how long the Android Emulator plugin should wait for the emulator to start at the beginning of a build.
<p>
    This is useful, for example, if starting the emulator takes some considerable time - for instance if you are unable to use hardware acceleration.
    By default the plugin waits for 360 seconds. This value is doubled to 720 seconds for first time boots without an initial snapshot.<br/>
