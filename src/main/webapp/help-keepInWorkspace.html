With this option enabled, all the Android emulators will be kept in a workspace-specific directory.
This has a few implications:

<ul>
  <li>Emulators for different jobs will be <em>completely</em> isolated</li>
  <li>Workspaces will take up more space</li>
  <li>You can easily clear out emulators &amp; snapshots by deleting the workspace</li>
</ul>
