<div>
  The names of existing Android emulator configurations (AVDs) can be seen by running the
  following command from the Android SDK: <tt>android list avd</tt>.
<p>
  The AVD must already exist at build time on the machine the build will be executed on &mdash;
  the emulator configuration will not be automatically created or copied from another machine.
</p>
  You can also do environment variable substitution for this setting, in the format:
  <tt>${VARIABLE_NAME}</tt> or <tt>$VARIABLE_NAME</tt>.
