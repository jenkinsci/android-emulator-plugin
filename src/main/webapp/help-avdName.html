  The names of existing Android emulator configurations (AVDs) can be seen by running the 
  following command from the Android SDK: <code>android list avd</code>.
<p>
  The AVD must already exist at build time on the machine the build will be executed on &mdash;
  the emulator configuration will not be automatically created or copied from another machine.
</p>
  You can also do environment variable substitution for this setting, in the format:
  <var>${VARIABLE_NAME}</var> or <var>$VARIABLE_NAME</var>.
