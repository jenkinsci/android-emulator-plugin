If this option is selected, the Android emulator being run will be deleted when the build ends.<br/>
This means permanantly erasing all of its files, snapshots and metadata from disk on the current
build machine.
<p/>
This happens in all cases, regardless of:
<ul>
<li>why the build ended</li>
<li>what the build outcome is</li>
<li>whether the emulator has custom properties or not</li>
<li>whether the emulator was created at the start of the build</li>
</ul>
