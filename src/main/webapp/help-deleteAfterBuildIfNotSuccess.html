If this option is selected, the Android emulator being run will be deleted when the build ends only if the build did not succeed.<br/>
This means permanantly erasing all of its files, snapshots and metadata from disk on the current
build machine.<br/>
Note: This option is overriden by the option to always delete the emulator after build regardless of the outcome.
